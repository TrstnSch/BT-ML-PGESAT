\section{Motivation and Background}
MOTIVATION SAT! Advancements in deep learning SAT solving, e.g. NeuroSAT. Need for evaluation of these models, use of GNN explainers as SAT can be reduced to graph domain. Application of PGExplainer on NeruoSAT to generate explanations. Explanations need gt to be evaluated on accuracy. Use concepts like unsat cores and backbones as gt and compare to explanations provided by PGExplainer to see whether NeuroSAT explanations align with "human-observable" principles.
Therefore explanation and replication of PGExplainer. After successful replication, application on NeuroSAT. \bigskip
Graph task: Prediction of UNSAT and unsat cores as gt. Node task: Difficult with NeuroSAT?

\section{Related Work}
TODO: MOVE TO BEFORE CONCLUSION?! MOVE TO THEORETICAL BACKGROUND?! \\
Original PGExplainer? We seek to provide a reimplementation using PyG framework and reproduce the results. \bigskip
TODO: Move criticism to discussion? \bigskip
Existing reimplementation of PGExplainer using PyG by Holdijk et al. Unable to achieve results of original implementation. Improvement on some datasets, considerable deterioration on BA-2Motif. Criticize approach of original and lacklustre documentation as well as differences between codebase and paper. We try own implementation to further improve results. We follow the configs used in the reimplementation but conduct sweeps ourselves around these and the original configs. Compare results to both implementations. \\
Taxonomy paper evaluates PGExplainer on Fidelty and achieves low scores, sides with reproducibility paper above: "is not performing as promising as its original
reported results". Propose only using PGExplainer for Node classification task.\bigskip
NeuroSAT as downstream task for SAT experiments with PGExplainer. PyG reimplementation code provided by Rodhi. We create required data with provided methods, add unsat cores as gt and adapt the NeuroSAT model to allow passing edge weights into the adjacency matrix. PGExplainer adapted for SAT data, NeuroSAT embeddings and evaluation.
