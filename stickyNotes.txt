Current „Problems“:
BA-Shapes: Weird Loss
BA-Community, Tree-Grid: Look stable
Tree-Cycles: VERY high Variance in sampledEdgeSum and AUC       DID NOT USE PYTORCH CONFIGS
BA-2Motif: Scuffed Loss, high AUC variance, AUC decreasing!     DID NOT USE PYTORCH CONFIGS
MUTAG: Loss a bit jumpy                                         DID NOT USE PYTORCH CONFIGS






BA-2Motif needs ones as features!!!!!! nevermind!?!??!?! After significant changes the first run seems to be doing good, but then it gets worse?!






Tree-Grid experiment ran on 511, 800, 9 with 512,800, 9 eval.
Compare to original 511, 800, 1!

Original seems to be worse?









BA-2Motif problem:

Predictions of sampled graphs do not really make sense. The edges probabilities are fine and seem well distributed, but the predictions seem to stagnate

[[0.4585, 0.5415], [0.4604, 0.5396], [0.4527, 0.5473], [0.4566, 0.5434], [0.4617, 0.5383], [0.4666, 0.5334], [0.4573, 0.5427], [0.4607, 0.5393], [0.4527, 0.5473], [0.4574, 0.5426], [0.4583, 0.5417], [0.4540, 0.5460], [0.4603, 0.5397], [0.4609, 0.5391], [0.4614, 0.5386], [0.4579, 0.5421]] 










MUTAG seems to be doing good now? Try a few runs

BUT: AUC decreases over epochs(sometimes). Constant around 70-75%. Validate auc metric in general! GT seems to constantly be the highest weighted edges








TreeGrid seems to work
TreeCycles seems to work relatively good, between 60 and 80%?






Vermutung: Use normalize during training, but not during explainer training?!
-> This leads to bad accuracy outside of training!






BA2-Motif working!?
-No combine edge weights
-No normalization in ds task
-No argmax for Loss
-Loss from paper
-BA-2Motif latest model (no normalization!?)

BUT runs where AUC goes from 99 to 90% and back up to 95%









TRIED REMOVING COMBINE_EDGE_WEIGHTS

BA-2Motif:
Almost all weights tend to turn negative over time, between -0.5 and -0.08. At start all weights positive

Prediction of graph with edge_weights edge_ij is ALWAYS 0!

Using GCNConv instead of GraphConv gets at least some 1 class predictions. AUC at 27%










Normalize added to graph downstream task:
AUC decreases to 0 really fast. Learns the wrong way, but very accurate!!!!

Layer norm in Node Task(Tree-Cycles) leads to better performance in explainer, but also learns to predict minimal weights!
BatchNorm with bad validation values leads to auc of 0.5?! Second run 0.7 but decreases ti 0.5 during later epochs.
USE 2 DIFFERENT BN LAYERS! -> Leads to AUC of 0.05, but increases slightly. LEARNS LOWEST

Tree-Grid learns with same 2 bn layers architecture highest edge weights?! Nearly perfect
Was lucky/random? Second run only around 0.58
Validation quite well though, seems to work well overall










BA-2Motif:
Added weight norm intro forward of explainer. ROC increases to around 90%! Does not steadily increase though and goes up and down.
Cheating?
Houses are detected perfectly, but only gives 5 instead of 6 ndoes. Circle does not work too well, 2 nodes are detected outside?
Seems like that was coincidence ☹️

Weight norm Leads to horrible performance on Tree-Cycles
Init weights for explainer seems to be a bad idea!

Tree-Cycle model without weight norm and init went from AUC of 1 to AUC of 0.5











Added edge weights of one of none given to node downstream task. 
BA-Shapes only has auc problems when additional motif node in graph
BA-Community around 60%, same problem as BA-Shapes(AUC increases if using edge weights instead of topK to 80%. AUC does not improve over epochs). Relatively high probabilies?
Tree-Cycles: Stable around 60%, seems to be missing connectivity constraint! Predicts 4/6 edges correctly, but prefers other tri connected node edges over „base“ motif node edges. CONNECTIVITY CONSTRAINT NOT USED IN OG!?

BA-2Motif: Same as MUTAG, just inverted. All weights are around 0. AUC decreases a lot
MUTAG: Ground truth still messed up + all edge probabilites 1















Swapped pOriginal and pSample in Loss.

BA-Shapes works well
BA-Community is inefficient!
Tree-Cycles does not work, stuck around 50
Tree-Grid does not work, stuck around 50
 Works well if only trained on „middle“ nodes of  Motif (Apparently not anymore)
BA-2Motif decreases AUC during training?!
 From 60% down to 40%
-> PROBLEM WITH NEGATIVE WEIGHTS -> Highest probabilites are 0?!
(Maybe graph impl. problem)
MUTAG is bad, because of bugged ground truth!!













BIGGEST PROBLEM: topK does not perfectly identify topK edges, because of bidirectional edges!!! If same vale edge weights at threshold different edges might be selected instead of always two belonging ones.
To fix: Maybe extract one direction of edges from edge_index and edge weights accordingly before evaluating/processing?
