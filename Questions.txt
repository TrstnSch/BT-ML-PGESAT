To compare baseline methods GRAD, ATT, Gradient: reimplement as well or take values from paper => Don't reimplement, take from somewhere

Accuracys of Model from best accuracy over all epochs, mean or last epoch?

How to create datasets on a singular graph?!




Use dropout => Sure, as long as eval() is used when not training

MLP learning lowest weights!! -> "Fixed" by setting ADAM to max or calculating reparam trick with -w_ij
 -> This is crucial, possible to "hotfix" with -1?

Performance on MUTAG?

How do I calc AUC?

Apply constraints => size+entropy done
Budget and Connectivity only for node!?

Mirror edge weights during training?? Fix efficient method!

Graph order determines whether learns highest or lowest?!?!
First 10 epochs learns to maximize, after minimizes?? TRY

Triple bonds are detect as double bonds, predicted edge should be there?
