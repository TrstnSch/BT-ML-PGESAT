\textbf{TODO: PGExplainer} \\
Original work by Luo et al.\cite{luo2020parameterized}; Original PGExplainer? SHORT SUMMARY. We seek to provide a reimplementation using PyG framework and reproduce the results, while also applying the framework to another domain, namely SAT problem in the form of bipartite graphs.\bigskip

\textbf{TODO: GNNExplainer} \\
Baseline for PGExplainer by Yuan et al.\cite{ying2019gnnexplainer}; DIFFERENCE TO PGEXPLAINER

\textbf{TODO: RE-PGExplainer} \\
Replication study of PGExplainer using pytorch by Holdijk et al.\cite{holdijk2021re};
Unable to achieve results of original implementation. Improvement on some datasets, considerable deterioration on BA-2Motif. Criticize approach of original and lacklustre documentation as well as differences between codebase and paper.
We try own reimplementation that follows the original paper, as well as code and reimplementation for uncertainties + use a slightly different architecture in underlying GNN + Hyperparameter search of combination of parameters used in original and repication. Treated as additional baseline\bigskip

\textbf{TODO: Taxonomy paper?}
Taxonomy paper evaluates PGExplainer on Fidelty and achieves low scores, sides with reproducibility paper above: "is not performing as promising as its original
reported results". Propose only using PGExplainer for Node classification task.\bigskip

\textbf{NeuroSAT}

NeuroSAT by Selsam et al.\cite{selsam2018learning} is a machine learning approach for solving the boolean satisfiability problem using a message passing neural network. It is able to detect satisfying assignments but lacks proofs of unsatisfiability. The authors performed a small study on the detection of unsat cores, revealing that NeuroUNSAT is able to detect UNSAT cores if the UNSAT problems contain a specific UNSAT core. However, this is expected to be due to the model memorizing the unsat cores, rather than generalizing to any unsat core. We want to test this by applying the PGExplainer to the NeuroSAT model, and evaluate whether the generated explanations do align with unsat cores. TODO: Code provided by rodhi?
