Understand GCN/GraphConv in PyG
 - DONE: Validate params

DONE: Implement + understand DataLoader   80/10/10 split 
 - Create Dataset classes from scratch (with logic from ExplainerDataset?) OR use from PyG
 - Understand masking data

training loop
 - params
 - optimizer Adam
 - initalization Xavier
 - DONE: train/test split
 - accuracy
 - ...
=> GNN models for different Datasets


implement Explainer/MLP
 - ADD, GNNExplainer, PGExplainer ?!?!

Explainer training loop
