Understand GCN/GraphConv in PyG
 - DONE: Validate params

DONE: Implement + understand DataLoader   80/10/10 split 
 - Create Dataset classes from scratch (with logic from ExplainerDataset?) OR use from PyG    PROBABLY NOT NEEDED
 - loading masks from dataset??? => Node masks vor train/val/test are created from RandomSplit
 - DONE: visualize Dataset, 
 - DONE: color node classes (optional)
 - TODO: Datasets for Node classification need to be generated once, saved and loaded to be static.
 - TODO: Validate creation of datasets!!
 - TODO: Combine graphs for BA-Community

training loop
 - params
 - DONE: optimizer Adam
 - DONE: initalization Xavier
 - DONE: train/test split
 - DONE: accuracy
 - DONE: plot!
 - ...
=> GNN models for different Datasets

Clean up
Create structure for different datasets/training loops. How to load/save parameters for each task?

NodeGNN


-------------- implement Explainer/MLP ---------------------
 - ADD, GNNExplainer, PGExplainer ?!?!

Explainer training loop


implement utils
