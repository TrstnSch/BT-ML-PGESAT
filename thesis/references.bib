abstract="Graphs are a kind of data structure which models a set of objects (nodes) and their relationships (edges). Recently, researches of analyzing graphs with machine learning have received more and more attention because of the great expressive power of graphs, i.e., graphs can be used as denotation of a large number of systems across various areas including social science (social networks) [Hamilton et al., 2017b, Kipf and Welling, 2017], natural science (physical systems [Battaglia et al., 2016, Sanchez et al., 2018] and protein-protein interaction networks [Fout et al., 2017]), knowledge graphs [Hamaguchi et al., 2017] and many other research areas [Khalil et al., 2017]. As a unique non-Euclidean data structure for machine learning, graph draws attention on analyses that focus on node classification, link prediction, and clustering. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are deep learning-based methods that operate on graph domain. Due to its convincing performance and high interpretability, GNN has been a widely applied graph analysis method recently. In the following paragraphs, we will illustrate the fundamental motivations of GNNs.",

abstract="Declarative specifications exhibit a variety of problems, such as inadvertently overconstrained axioms and underconstrained conjectures, that are hard to diagnose with model checking and theorem proving alone. Recycling core extraction is a new coverage analysis that pinpoints an irreducible unsatisfiable core of a declarative specification. It is based on resolution refutation proofs generated by resolution engines, such as SAT solvers and resolution theorem provers. The extraction algorithm is described, and proved correct, for a generalized specification language with a regular translation to the input logic of a resolution engine. It has been implemented for the Alloy language and evaluated on a variety of specifications, with promising results.",

abstract = {Summary
Many problems in biology require looking for a “needle in a haystack,” corresponding to a binary classification where there are a few positives within a much larger set of negatives, which is referred to as a class imbalance. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the associated area under the curve (AUC) have been reported as ill-suited to evaluate prediction performance on imbalanced problems where there is more interest in performance on the positive minority class, while the precision-recall (PR) curve is preferable. We show via simulation and a real case study that this is a misinterpretation of the difference between the ROC and PR spaces, showing that the ROC curve is robust to class imbalance, while the PR curve is highly sensitive to class imbalance. Furthermore, we show that class imbalance cannot be easily disentangled from classifier performance measured via PR-AUC.}
