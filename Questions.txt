To compare baseline methods GRAD, ATT, Gradient: reimplement as well or take values from paper => Don't reimplement, take from somewhere

Accuracys of Model from best accuracy over all epochs, mean or last epoch => Last epoch, or go back to earlier stage of model

How to create datasets on a singular graph => Simply use one data object(graph)

Use dropout => Sure, as long as eval() is used when not training




MLP learning lowest weights!! -> "Fixed" by setting ADAM to max or calculating reparam trick with -w_ij
 -> This is crucial, possible to "hotfix" with -1?

Performance on MUTAG?

How do I calc AUC? Different results for three different metrics

Apply constraints => size+entropy done
Budget and Connectivity only for node?

Mirror edge weights during training? Fix efficient method!

Graph order determines whether learns highest or lowest?!?!
First 10 epochs learns to maximize, after minimizes? Only on some architectures/hyperparams => TRY!

Triple bonds are detect as double bonds, predicted edge should be there?



WEIGHTS TEND TO BE WAY TOO HIGH FOR TREE-CYCLES. -> PROBABILITIES OF EDGES ARE ALL 1.
CAN BE REDUCED VIA L2NORM, ALTHOUGH APPARENTLY NOT USED IN ORIGINAL!
NORMALIZATION ERROR IN MY MODEL? WHERE? POSSIBLE CAUSES?

Take topK(motif) edges for node tasks as well! => Calculate AUC with topK set to 1, others set to 0 vs. GroundTruth



Background: How much into detail? Where to start? Neural Networks? Machine Learning? ...
Mathematical background -> Probably needed, how deep, where to start?
How to quote? Mathematical stuff/formulas quotes? General: Definitions from original works? Own "dictionary"? 

BA2Motif now struggling on 64 architecture. DOES NOT LEARN ANYMORE. Loss fluctuating!

Training of NodeExplainer: Train on motifs? Node splits of original do not really make sense?? Same for AUC evaluation. HOW CAN I GET EVERY MOTIF ONCE FROM MY DATASET??
    OR HOW CAN I VALIDATE ORIGINAL NODE SPLIT TO MAKE SENSE??
    Motfis I use to calculate AUC are Subragph edges where both connected nodes are of class 1.



When training TreeGrid explainer on all nodes: "Detects" motfis as lowest weights?! Probably simply wrong, since model just learns to detect base nodes as important since usually represented?
